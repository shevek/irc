tftp4j
======

A Java TFTP server and protocol handler.

This code originally came from a variety of third party open source
projects, and the objective is to give it a complete overhaul into
a modern, correct and complete TFTP implementation.

The [JavaDoc API](http://shevek.github.io/tftp4j/docs/javadoc/)
is available.
